<!-- For this website, I went with a blue color pallete since it's my favorite color. I thought that a lighter blue would make it look nice, but also still easy to read darker text, which I mady navy blue. Otherwise, the rest of the website is styled similarly to the example provided (Jenny Thinkful). -->
